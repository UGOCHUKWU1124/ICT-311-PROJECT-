Aim and Objectives

Aim:

Assess the impact of environmental factors on health outcomes.


Objectives:

Collect and analyze data on environmental and health factors.

Use statistical models to explore relationships.

Identify vulnerable populations.

Estimate long-term health effects.


Techniques Used

Correlation Analysis (Pearson correlation)

Regression Analysis (Linear regression models)

Spatial Analysis (Geographic distribution visualization)

Descriptive Statistics (Mean, standard deviation, etc.)


Data Description

The study includes:

Environmental Variables: PM (Particulate Matter), UFP (Ultrafine Particles), Walkability Index, Green Space, Fuel Consumption, Noise Pollution, etc.

Health Outcome Variables: Health Factor Index (HFI), Prevalence of Chronic Conditions (PCTS), Premature Mortality Rate (PRI), etc.


Key Findings

A strong positive correlation (r = 0.578, p < 0.001) was found between Ultrafine Particles (UFP) and Premature Mortality Rate (PRI).

The Walkability Index (WI) significantly predicts the Health Factor Index (HFI).

No strong spatial clustering was observed in environmental variables.

Descriptive statistics indicate high variability in air quality and health outcomes.


Visualizations

Bar Charts (Population size variations across neighborhoods)

Histograms (Differences in UFP levels across neighborhoods)

Pie Charts (Environmental and health factor distributions)


Conclusion

The study highlights the critical relationship between environmental factors and health outcomes. The findings emphasize the need for policy interventions to improve public health by mitigating environmental risks.
